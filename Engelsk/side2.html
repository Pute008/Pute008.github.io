        <h2>Stonehenge</h2>
        <p>
          Stonehenge is an ancient settlement from the stone age that lies around 13 kilometers north from Salisbury in Wiltshire, England.
          It’s a group of big rocks that have been there for centuries. They estimate that they were placed there around the stone age. Scientists have not found out why the rocks have been placed there, but they think it was used for religious purposes.
          Some people theorize that it was used for astrology.
