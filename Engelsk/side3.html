        <p>
          The granite image of King Ramesses II is the largest sculpture at the British museum.
          It’s an image of Ramesses II whose reign lasted almost 67 years. It was carved from one block, quarried at Aswan almost 124 miles further south.
          Like all Egyptian statues, it was originally painted.
          Pigments can still be found on this statue.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Nr2: The colossal granite head of King Amenhotep III

        <p>
          The colossal granite head of King Amenhotep III who reigned over Egypt until his death around 1370 BC commissioned numerous statues for himself, especially for his temple in Thebes, which was then Egypts capital
        </p>

        </h4>

        <img class="egyptian_bilde" src="bilder/Limestone_Egyptian_Rulres.jpg" alt="The Limestone of Egyptian Rulers">

        <p>
          The Limestone of Egyptian Rulers comes from a temple of Ramesses II.
          It’s a list of the past Egyptian kings who roamed over egypt.
          It was created to express the living ruler's legitimacy. The kings are represented by their throne names, written in oval ‘cartouches’.
          Rulers that were deemed unimportant or illegitimate, including queens were omitted from this list.
          They only used the ruler's throne name.
        </p>

        <p>
