        <h1>Why should you travel to England?</h1>
        <p>
          England has a wide range of attractions and historical settlements that you can explore and visit.
          You can go and visit the British Royal Family’s castle, or see Big Ben and London Eye. You can also meet celebrities, such as Michal Jackson, Queen Elizabeth II or Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), as wax sculptures in Madame Tussauds.
          Are you interested in football? Then you have come to the right place. You can experience live Premier League matches or you can see them at a local pub. These are some of the reasons why YOU should travel to England.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is the English language important to us?</h2>
        <p>
          English has had a big impact on our lives. We often use English when communicating with people in other countries who don't speak the same language as us.
          We also use English in social media to read news articles, watch movies and communicate on SOME platforms (Twitter, FaceBook, Youtube, etc).
          This is because English has become the lingua franca of today's world, and this can be traced back to England's colonization.

        <h2>England's history</h2>
        <p>
          England's history began in the year 43 AD in the period where the Roman empire conquered land from all around europe.
          England takes its name from the Angles who were a Germanic tribe who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. Around the 18th century Great Britain was founded. Wales had been in union with England since 1536, while Ireland became a part of Great Britain in 1801. In 1921 most of Ireland broke free Great Britain and formed the Irish Free State which later became the Republic of Ireland.
          England was now part of Great Britain together with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

        <h2>England's political system</h2>
        <p>
          England is a monarchy. The monarchy’s king is Charles III of England. He became king of England in 2022 when his mother Queen Elizabeth II died at the age of 96.
          King Charles III is also the king of the Commonwealth. This includes 56 different countries around the world. Including e.g Australia, Canada and South Africa.
          The Commonwealth has its roots from England's colonization around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          England has a Prime Minister, and this is the highest role you can have in the political system in England.
          The government is led by the Prime Minister and he is also the leader of the House of Commons. The government can have up to 100 members.
          Their political system is a part of Great Britain and North-Ireland's democratic and parliamentary unitary state.
        </p>

        <h2>Food and Drinks</h2>
        <p>
          In England you will find a multicultural kitchen. It is a multi ethnic society, with different backgrounds and they have taken their food culture with them.
          So in England, when it comes to food, you can have whatever your heart desires. But a well known food dish is Fish`n Chips. And in your local pub you can enjoy a real English breakfast.
          But maybe most important of all, at the pub you will be served an English pint.
