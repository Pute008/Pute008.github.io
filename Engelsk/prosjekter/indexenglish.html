            <h1>What is so special about England?</h1>
            <p>
                England has had a big impact on our lives. They have traveled all around the world and conquered many countries where they have shared their traditions with other people. England's history began in the year 43 ftk in the period where the Roman empire conquered land from all around europe.
                Around the 18th century Great Britain was founded. Wales had been in union with England since 1536, while Ireland became a part of Great Britain in 1801. In 1921 most of Ireland broke free Great Britain and formed the Irish Free State which later became the Republic of Ireland.
            </p>

            <p>
                English has also had a big impact on our lives. We often use English when communicating with people in other countries who don't speak the same language as us or when we use social media to read news articles and watch movies. This is because English has become the lingua franca of today's world. One reason for this is because of colonization in the 15th hundreds.

            <h1>Why should you travel to England?</h1>

            <p>
                You should travel to England for many reasons, England is a big part of our history, they have colonized all around the world and made English the Lingua Franca of the world. They fought in 2 world wars, and English as a language has had a big impact on social media and media all around the world.

            <p>
                If you like to see historical "things" (kommer til å forandre på!!!) or if you want to experience what it's like to see a live Premier Leauge match or to take a beer at a pub (if your old enough), England is the perfect place for you
