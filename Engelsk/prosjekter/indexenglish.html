            <h1>What is so special about England?</h1>
            <p>
                England has had a big impact on our lives. They have traveled all around the world and conquered many countries where they have shared their traditions with other people.
                England's history began in the year 43 AD in the period where the Roman empire conquered land from all around europe. Around the 18th century Great Britain was founded.
                Wales had been in union with England since 1536, while Ireland became a part of Great Britain in 1801. In 1921 most of Ireland broke free Great Britain and formed the Irish Free State which later became the Republic of Ireland.        
            </p>

            <p>
                English has also had a big impact on our lives. We often use English when communicating with people in other countries who don't speak the same language as us or when we use social media to read news articles and watch movies.
                This is because English has become the lingua franca of today's world. One reason for this is because of colonization in the 15th hundreds.

            <p>
                England has a wide range of attractions and historical settlements that you can explore and visit.
                You can go and visit the British Royal Familyâ€™s castle, or see Big Ben and the London eye. You can also watch wax sculptures of celebrities such as Michal Jacson, Queen Elizabeth the 2th or Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). If you want to experience what it's like to see a live Premier League match or to have a beer at a pub (if you're old enough). These are some of the reasons why YOU should travel to England.
